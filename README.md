##Project Name: San Pablo Pharmacy Management System

###Introduction:
During the pandemic, San Pablo Pharmacy faced increased demand for various medications. However, the pharmacy's operational system was inefficient, especially in providing inventory status and managing high volumes of orders through different channels. The director needed a program to efficiently check inventory and control sales data.

Problem Statement:
The existing system did not allow easy access to inventory information, requiring manual checks for each customer query. Additionally, the director struggled to track sales data, including total sales, months with highest and lowest sales, average sales, and months exceeding the average sales.

Project Objective:
The goal was to develop a quality software program that efficiently manages the San Pablo Pharmacy. The program aims to resolve issues related to medication inventory, track total sales, identify months with highest and lowest sales, calculate average sales, and identify months with above-average sales.

Key Features:

Efficient inventory checking without needing manual verification in the storage area.
Tracking and analysis of total sales data.
Identification of months with highest and lowest sales for targeted promotions.
Calculation of average monthly sales and identification of months with sales above this average.
